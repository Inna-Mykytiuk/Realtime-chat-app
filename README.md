# React-Native-ToDo-List

####
Simple React-Native ToDo app allows users to create a list of tasks and delete tasks from that list. Here's an overview of how app works:
####
When the app opens, the user sees an empty list of tasks.
The user can add a new task to the list by typing it into a text input and pressing a "+" button.
The new task is added to the bottom of the list with a checkbox next to it indicating that it is incomplete.
The user can delete a task from the list by tapping on it.
When a task is tapped, it is removed from the list.
Some additional features you might consider adding to your app could include:

You can view the application using the Expo program installed locally on your computer, or Expo go from your mobile device.
